## Platform support

Mac OS 10.15 and later.

## Function introduction

Most of the software that currently provides similar functions is implemented in a file-driven way. However, to load third-party drivers on Mac systems, a series of complex system settings are required to reduce the system's security policy, and it is run in command line mode, which is very difficult for ordinary users. Through technical research, we have provided a new implementation method that does not require drivers. We have done a lot of work so that users can use it normally without changing any system security settings, which is no different from ordinary software. Users only need to click a switch to easily implement its read and write functions.
